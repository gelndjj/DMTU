### HOW IT WORKS - VIDEOS
######  ENCRYPT/DECRYPT

Explanations are written on the main screen.<br>
Each icons has a different function to encrypt/decrypt.

Once the files are encrypted, the script generates 3 files at root.<br>
They all are named by the timestamp.<br><br>
For instance:<br>
```20230427-230944.txt --> the encrypted key```<br>
```20230427-230944p.txt --> the path where the files have benn encrypted from ```<br>
```20230427-230944.mu --> the necessary secret key file to decrypt```<br><br>

The necessary secret key to decrypt will be available in the first menu as soon as the files are encrypted.<br>
